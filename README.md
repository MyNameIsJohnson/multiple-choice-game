## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS components
- CSS Flex Box
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Typescript](https://typescript.com/)

### What I learned
- In this project, I learned how to conditionally render content based on their state. I found this very exciting and enjoyed writing script that determines when certain components should be rendered. This gave me a better understanding of the user experience. 
- I learned the basics of typescript and am leaning more on using typescript for future projects. I appreciate that this framework is very opinionated and helped me debug any errors that arise beforehand. 
- I am very happy to learn how to have more control with my styling. Using conditional render of CSS in this project was mind blowing and a skill I will take to future projects.
